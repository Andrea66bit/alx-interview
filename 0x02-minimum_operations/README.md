FORCE OF LIFE IS PROGRAMMED IN THE MIND
A mock technical interview featuring Gavin and myself where we go through some introductions, high level conceptual technical questions, as well as four coding questions together. This style of interview is similar to something you'd see at the Junior to Intermediate level when applying for software developer or web developer positions.

In this interview we are coding with Javascript as that is what Gavin has been studying and working with, however the structure and style should be similar for all types of technical interviews at this level.

Thank you Gavin for braving the recording with me and allowing others to learn from us!

Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.


Dynamic Programming

For example, if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers, we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.
